# Blind-Docking-for-Target-Fishing-based-on-Autodock
An autodock-based blind docking Target Fishing script. Used when protein loci are not known. Can be run on multiple cores.

## 1. Introduction
This is an AutoDock-based blind docking target fishing script used for docking when the protein binding sites are unknown. It can be run on multiple cores.

## 2. Principle
The implementation principle of this script is to automatically segment the receptor into multiple parts, perform docking separately, and output the score for each pose of each part.

## 3. Features
- Automatically processes multiple protein files, generates grid files, and performs docking on different regions of each protein.
- Utilizes multi-threading to accelerate the processing.
- Outputs docking results and scores to files.

## 4. Usage
1. Installation needs to be secured before running:
   - autodock vina 
   - `os`
   - `subprocess`
   - `multiprocessing`
   - `tqdm`
2. Preprocess the ligand and save it in PDBQT format.
3. Preprocess the receptor files and breaking them down into individual chains, saving them in PDBQT format, and storing them in a folder.
4. Set the following variables in the script:
   - `ligand_file`: Path to the PDBQT file of the small molecule ligand
   - `protein_dir`: Directory path containing the protein PDBQT files
   - `output_dir`: Directory path for output results
   - `overlap`: Box overlap size (Ã…) (recommended to be adjusted based on the size of the small molecule ligand)
   - `cpu`: Number of cores to be used per process (recommended to be 4, adjustable based on computer configuration)
   - `exhaustiveness`: Default is 8; it is recommended to read the explanation in the official documentation and adjust as needed
   - `processes`: Total number of cores to be used

5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python dock.py
   ```
